\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at DTU Compute in fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering.

This thesis deals with the design of a hardware accelerator for the training of neural networks. Low-level design is one of my greatest passions and thus it has been an absolute privilege to have been given the opportunity to combine hardware with the surging field of machine learning.
