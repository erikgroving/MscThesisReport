\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Jens Sparsø for his time and guidance throughout the entire duration of my thesis. Our regular meetings helped me to stay grounded and to think critically about my project.

I would also like to thank my former classmate, Cheng Fu, who is currently a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego. My conversations with him at the beginning of my foray into this thesis helped me establish my footing.

\chapter{GitHub Repository Organization}
Since the scope of this thesis is fairly wide, several different technologies and programming languages were used in the project. As such, this section was added to help guide the reader around the organization of the GitHub repository\footnote{\url{
		https://github.com/erikgroving/NeuralNetworkHardwareAccelerator/}}. 
The organization is shown on the frontpage of the repository in the README. It may also be read in textform by viewing the \textit{README.md} file in the repository.
