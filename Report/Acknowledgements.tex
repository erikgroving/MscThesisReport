\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Jens Spars√∏ for his time and guidance throughout the entire duration of my thesis. Our regular meetings helped me to stay grounded and to think critically about my project.

I would also like to thank my former classmate, Cheng Fu, who is currently a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego. My conversations with him at the beginning of my foray into this thesis helped me establish my footing.
