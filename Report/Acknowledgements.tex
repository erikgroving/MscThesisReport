\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Jens Spars√∏ for his time and guidance throughout the entire duration of my thesis. Our regular meetings helped me to stay grounded and to think critically about my project.

I would also like to thank my former classmate, Cheng Fu, PhD student of the University of California, San Diego. My conversation with him at the beginning of my foray into the research literature helped me establish my footing.
